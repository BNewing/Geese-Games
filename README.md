# Geese Games

## What is this app?
This is a basic React app that I'm creating to help learn React. 

I also really love geese, which are totally underrated and underappreciated animals! So I thought I'd write a silly little information and quiz site about them in the process of learning about React. It's been fun so far!

I was finding React a little intimidating and overwhelming, so I bought Wes Bos' [reactforbeginners.com](reactforbeginners.com) course with training budget to get me started and then branched out to this with lots of help from the Facebook documentation. Really recommend those things if you're starting out learning React!

I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to start me off. 


## Tech Stack
- React
- CSS (BEM)

Planning to learn Redux and put that in next!


## Plans for this app
- Pop-ups with info on the various geese types on the Geese Types page
- A functional quiz which gives you a score at the end!


## Issues
If you see any issues with my code, please do raise issues on the repo! Any feedback or tips are greatly appreciated =) likewise if there is anything I can do to make any of the app or the code more understandable, do leave issues too!
