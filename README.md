# Geese Games

## What is this app?
This is a basic React app that I'm creating to help learn React. I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to start me off. 

I really love geese, which are totally underrated and underappreciated animals in my opinion... So I thought I'd write a silly little information and quiz site about them, to help me learn how to use React. It's been fun so far!

I was finding React a little intimidating and overwhelming, and I was really struggling to get to grips with it. After asking around, I was recommended and then got Wes Bos' [reactforbeginners.com](reactforbeginners.com) course to get me started. That has been fantastic! Then, when I started up this project, I often referred to the [Facebook documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html). Really recommend those resources!

This is still very much a work in progress but it's fun and I'm learning lots!


## Tech Stack
- React
- CSS (BEM)

Planning to learn Redux and put that in next!


## Plans for this app
- Pop-ups with info on the various geese types on the Geese Types page
- A functional quiz which gives you a score at the end!


## Issues
If you see any issues with my code, please do raise issues on the repo! Any feedback or tips are greatly appreciated =) likewise if there is anything I can do to make any of the app or the code more understandable, do leave issues too!
