# Geese Games

## What is this app?
This is a basic React app that I'm creating to help learn React. I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to start me off. 

I really love geese, which are totally underrated and underappreciated animals in my opinion... So I thought I'd write a light-hearted little information and quiz site about them, to help me learn how to use React. 

I was finding React a little intimidating and overwhelming, and I was really struggling to get to grips with it. After asking around, I was recommended and then got Wes Bos' [reactforbeginners.com](reactforbeginners.com) course to get me started. That has been fantastic! Then, when I started up this project, I often referred to the [Facebook documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html). 

This is still very much a work in progress but it's fun and I'm learning lots!

## Tech Stack
- React
- Styled-components for CSS

## Plans for this app
- Pop-ups with info on the various geese types on the Geese Types page
- A functional quiz which gives you a score at the end!
